# Rifk7-2018-Fix
Fix for the 2018 version of Rifk7, along with the ida database that has all of the modifications

credits to the people who originally helped me find out how 2 fix
I think it was zenox like 5 months ago

general information:

1. Menu Key: Delete

2. Cheat function binds (ALL FUNCTION BINDS CAN BE FOUND ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF YOUR SCREEN WHILE THE MENU IS OPEN ASWELL) :

+--------------------------------------+
F1 : Activates Rage 
F2 : Activate Autowall
F3 : Activate Anti-Aim
F4 : Activate Buy-Bot
F5 : Activate Functions 1-4 altogether 
F6 : Aimstep
F7 : Allow Untrusted
F8 : Kifferking Roundsay
F9 : Rifk7 Clantag
F10 : Hide name
+--------------------------------------+

3. ALL UNTRUSTED EXPLOITS WILL NOT WORK AND WILL CAUSE YOUR GAME TO INSTANTLY CRASH

4. Debug Features will not remain in configs so make sure you remember to activate any that you might use

setup help:
1. Make sure you are using an injector that utilizes Load Library, or it will fail to inject.
2. Make sure you have visual studio redistributables
